# Frieren Release Repository

This repository serves as the primary hub for the distribution of the Frieren project's releases and installation scripts. It is intended to complement the main Frieren repository by providing ready-to-deploy packages and the necessary tools to install Frieren on various platforms.

## Repository Structure

- **`/install`**: This directory contains scripts for installing Frieren. These scripts simplify the process of setting up Frieren on different operating systems and environments.
- **`/packages`**: Here you'll find the compiled packages and binaries of Frieren, ready for deployment. Each package is tailored for specific architectures and platforms.

## Installation

To install Frieren using the scripts provided in this repository, navigate to the `/install` directory and follow the instructions in the scripts. The typical installation process would look something like this:

```bash
cd install
bash install-frieren.sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, Frieren can be accessed through its web interface or via API calls, depending on your installation type and configuration. Please refer to the main [Frieren repository](https://github.com/xchwarze/frieren) for detailed documentation on using and configuring Frieren.
